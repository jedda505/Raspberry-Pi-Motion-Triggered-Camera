# Raspberry-Pi-Motion-Triggered-Camera
A home/hobby project using Raspberry Pi. Scripts for a basic motion detect security / nature camera made using a raspberry pi. 

Motion_sensor_test.py tests the motion sensor and tells you when it detects motion.

Main_cam.py runs the camera and takes 15 second videos when it takes motion.
